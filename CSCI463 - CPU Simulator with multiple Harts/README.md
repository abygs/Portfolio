# Project for CSCI463

This project simulates a CPU with multiple harts. 

Usage: rv32i [-d] [-i] [-r] [-z] [-l exec-limit] [-m hex-mem-size] infile
    -d show disassembly before program execution
    -i show instruction printing during execution
    -l maximum number of instructions to exec
    -m specify memory size (default = 0x100)
    -r show register printing during execution
    -z show a dump of the regs & memory after simulation
