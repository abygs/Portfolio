# 2AIndustries Group Project for CSCI467

This project simulates multiple aspects of an internet company. It allows customers to access a database of company products and place them in a modifiable cart. The system will simluate a credit card payment upon purchasing and pass the order to a warehouse simulation site as well as generate an invoice. The warehouse site is password protected and holds all the orders and their processing statuses. The warehouse site also keeps inventory of all products in stock. The last part of this project is an admin interface that is also password protected. This interface allows the user to view databases of all orders, products, and customers.

Note: this was devleoped to work only on NIU's webserver and database.
