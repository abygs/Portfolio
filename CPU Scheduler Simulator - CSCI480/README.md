# CPU Scheduler Simulator

This program simulates a CPU scheduler by creating input or output processes according to either the First Come First Served algorithm or Round Robin algorithm. </br>
It will default the time quantum to 5 if it is left blank and use Round Robin, unless the quantum is greater than 100. Then it will use First Come First Served.

Usage: ./z1893909_project4 inputFile quantum(optional)
